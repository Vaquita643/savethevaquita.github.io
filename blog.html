                            <p> Among the rarest aquatic mammals in the world is the Vaquita. There are between 12 and 19 in the wild and the small porpoise is on the verge of becoming extinct as it doesn’t do well in captivity.
                                The vaquita is the smallest cetacean on earth and is a cousin of the largest animal in the world, the blue whale. While they feed on fish, prawns and crabs, they are most partial to squid. Vaquitas have chunky bodies, rounded heads and dark rings around their eyes and mouths, 
                                which may account for their common name (vaquita means “little cow” in Spanish). In 2017, scientists from the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA in Spanish) tried a controversial plan: Capture vaquitas, keep them in net pens in the Gulf, and hope they would reproduce. 
                                Of the two females they caught, one had to be released almost immediately as she showed signs of distress while the other equally stressed out vaquita died a few hours later, likely due to a cardiac arrest.

                            <p> There may be a glimmer of hope for the extremely rare vaquita porpoise, the world’s smallest cetacean, a group that includes whales, dolphins and porpoises. The vaquita is also the most threatened marine mammal in the world, nearly extinct because of entanglement in fishing nets.
                                The latest expeditions to survey the mammal in the northern Gulf of California, Mexico, have yielded sightings of both vaquita mothers and calves. This, researchers say, indicates that the small porpoises are still reproducing despite threats.
                                “So the good news is they are producing calves,” Lorenzo Rojas-Bracho, who leads marine mammal research at Mexico’s National Commission on Protected Areas (CONANP), told the San Diego Union Tribune. “And we have the survivors who have been able to survive all these years, and it’s important to protect them,
                                because the survival of vaquita depends on these individuals we have now.”
                                During the summer of 2018, fewer than 19 vaquitas (Phocoena sinus) were estimated to survive in the Gulf of California, according to a recent study. This year, in a survey carried out between August and September, researchers spotted what they say are likely six distinct individual vaquitas. During a subsequent expedition in October, researchers say that they spotted vaquitas several times, including six different vaquitas in two groups. They also sighted three pairs of mothers and calves, said Rojas-Bracho.
                                In 2017 and 2018, too, the researchers had observed vaquita mothers and babies. In fact, they saw the same female with two separate calves in 2017 and 2018, suggesting that vaquitas may be capable of producing calves every year. Scientists previously thought that vaquitas give birth every other year.
                                This news is hopeful, but the mammal’s future is still perilous due to the continued use of illegal fishing nets in its habitat, the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA) said in a report published earlier this year.

                        <p> There are fewer than 19 vaquita porpoises thought to be left, according to a study. In 2016, estimates of the vaquita population stood at just 30, but research published in Royal Society Open Science suggests the figure has fallen further.
                            “Based on the uncertainty inherent in the models, the number could be as few as six,” said Prof Len Thomas, a statistician at the University of St Andrews and an author on the study.
                            The vaquita population lives in an area at the upper corner of the Gulf of California in Mexico. To estimate their numbers, the researchers recorded the vaquitas’ echolocation clicks using a large grid of acoustic sensors stationed over their habitat. Combined with visual sightings, the data shows a decline of 98.6% since monitoring started in 2011.
                            The critically endangered species get caught and drowned as a bycatch in gillnets. These nets are vertically suspended in water and the spacing of the mesh is supposed to allow only fish of certain size to be caught, but in practice marine mammals and sea turtles can quickly become entangled and drown. Although the Mexican government banned gillnets in 2015, illegal fishing with them has continued and 10 dead vaquitas have been found caught in them since the ban. Those using gillnets are aiming to catch totoaba, a large marine fish whose swim bladder – an 
                            inflatable organ that helps to maintain buoyancy in the water – is highly prized in China for use in traditional medicine. Dr Peter Evans, an honorary senior lecturer at Bangor University who was not involved in the study, said: “This paper by a group of very reputable scientists graphically demonstrates the precarious situation for [vaquita], with less than 20 estimated to remain on this planet. “It is just possible that some individuals may have escaped notice in areas outside the core study area, and there are challenges in determining numbers from porpoise echolocation detections. 
                            However, the authors have done their very best to try to overcome these in the analyses conducted in the paper. The only way to save the species would be to ban fishing of this type in the Gulf of California.” Thomas added: “We only have about a year left to save [the vaquita] from going extinct. The good news is that it’s a simple solution. With enough resources the Mexican government could protect them by cracking down on illegal fishing nets. We’re talking about an area less than the size of Greater London. “The Mexican navy is perfectly capable of excluding those boats from the area. My hope is that through publicity we will inspire the Mexican government to undertake effective enforcement.” Eva Hidalgo, science fepartment coordinator at Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, said, 
                            “The important takeaway is that they’re still out there. No matter how low the numbers are, there’s still hope for the species if we manage to keep them safe. Sea Shepherd is doing as much as possible to ensure the area remains net-free. In recent years we have seen two vaquita calves, so they can be saved. As long as there is one vaquita left, we are going to continue to fight for them.”
